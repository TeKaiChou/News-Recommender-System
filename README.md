# News-Recommender-System with content-based filtering
Here is an example of building a news recommendation system based on a content-based filtering algorithm. The idea of building the recommendation system using this algorithm is to ask about new users' preferences when they first sign up, offering a way to address the cold start issue of recommendation systems. With enough information on users' behavior, we can turn to apply the collaborative filtering algorithm to provide more personalized recommendations.
